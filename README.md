# Dobro

An all-purpose Discord Bot made by me with the help of friends

Made entirely with JavaScript, using Discord.js v12 (v13 rework is being worked on but there is no eta at this time)

# Setup

First, download the files, or clone the github.
Next, take the files out of the ZIP, and put them in their own folder.
Open CMD/Powershell, and cd to the folder, then run, npm i
After doing this, input the token in the config. And do npm .
And you're good to go!

Remember to put your bot info like token, prefix, MongoDB connection link etc. in the conf.json
You can just rename the exampleconf.json to conf.json
